        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        
        <h3>Local Storage:</h3>
        <p>All medical data is stored locally on your device with AES-256 encryption. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly enable iCloud sync or use sharing features like emergency alerts.</p>

        <h3>iCloud Sync (Optional - Premium Feature):</h3>
        <p>If you enable iCloud backup, your data is stored in your personal iCloud account using Apple's end-to-end encryption. We do not have access to your iCloud data. Apple manages iCloud security and encryption keys.</p>

        <h3>Security Measures:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AES-256 encryption for data at rest</li>
            <li>HTTPS/TLS encryption for data in transit</li>

            <li>Regular security audits and updates</li>
            <li>No central database storing user medical information</li>
            <li>Sandboxed app environment per iOS security model</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Widget Data:</h3>
        <p>Lock screen widgets display limited information (blood type, critical allergies, primary contact). Widget data is stored in a shared container accessible to the widget extension but remains on your device with encryption.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        
        <h3>We DO NOT:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sell your personal or medical information</li>
            <li>Share your data with third-party advertisers</li>
            <li>Access your medical information stored on your device</li>
            <li>Share data with insurance companies</li>

            <li>Use your data for marketing or advertising purposes</li>
            <li>Provide your information to data brokers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>We MAY share information only in these circumstances:</h3>

            <li>With emergency contacts when YOU trigger an emergency alert</li>
            <li>When required by law, court order, or legal process</li>
            <li>To protect rights, property, or safety of users or others</li>
            <li>With service providers who assist in app operations under strict confidentiality agreements (e.g., crash reporting services)</li>
            <li>In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets (users will be notified)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Emergency Alerts:</h3>
        <p>When you trigger an emergency alert or fail to check in on the check-in timer, the app sends SMS messages to your designated emergency contacts. This data sharing is initiated by you and sent directly through your device's messaging service.</p>
